Title: Webservices - ESP
Description: CITSmart - ESP Webservices

Webservices ESP -Enterprise Service Platform
==============

This document is intended to provide guidance regarding the Web Services made available for integration with CTSmart ITSM Service Management.
<br>
Web Services have been created in CTSmart ESP for inclusion, updating, consultation and cancellation of service requests (incidents and requisitions).


##Before getting started


1.  Before any CITSmart REST operation is used, the user must be authenticated.
2.  Authentication is done through the REST login operation in the URL **/services/login**, which receives a **CtLogin** object containing the **userName**, **password**, and **platform** attributes.
3.  The platform attribute must contain the ID of the site that is requesting the service.
4.  The login operation returns an alphanumeric value in the **SessionID** attribute. This same **SessionID** must be used in the other REST calls. The returned object contains the code and description of the error in case of problems in executing the login operation.
5.  The authenticated user composes the key for data synchronization, when the **synchronize** attribute is set to **true**.
6.  Request inclusion and update services rely on the **synchronize** attribute. When this attribute is **true**, the user registration and catalog services are automatically created or updated in CITSmart from the information sent in the Web Service request.

>   **RULE: all REST services created in CITSmart receive an input object and return an object. In case of error, the return object contains the code and description of the error. When there is no error, in addition to the attributes defined for each service, the return object contains the date and time of execution and the id of the operation. CITSmart ensures that every request is recorded in its database and an operation ID is returned to the requester, even in case of error.**
